        <h2>Your Task</h2>
        <p>Your task is to visualize the comparison of budgets.</p>
        <p> The module <em>floatCharts.budget</em> contains a
            service for retrieving budget data. The app should visualize the current years budget and a comparison with
            last year.</p>
        <p>How the data should be presented is up to you. Also feel free to install third-party libs as you need and
            create all the angular components/directives, services, filters and other stuff you need.</p>
        <p>Commit your work via git (maybe like in a normal workflow and not all-in-one) and reach us when you are
            finished.</p>
