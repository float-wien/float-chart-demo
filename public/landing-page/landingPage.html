        <h2>Your Task</h2>
        <p>Your task is to visualize the comparison of budgets.</p>
        <p> The module <em>floatCharts.budget</em> contains a
            service for retrieving budget data.</p>
        <p>The costType may be selectable in the frontend (i.e. show me the numbers/charts
            for NETNET), but all amounts must have the same costType, (the four different costTypes must not be mixed).
        </p>Additionally we want to see the progression of the budget over 2 year (i.e. compare
            2016 with 2017). Did we spend in 2017 less than in 2016, then use a red/signal color or
            find another way to display this situation in a suitable chart/manner)
        </p>
        <p>How the data should be presented is up to you. Also feel free to install third-party libs as you need and
            create all the angular components/directives, services, filters and other stuff you need.</p>
        <p>Commit your work via git (maybe like in a normal workflow and not all-in-one) and reach us when you are
            finished.</p>
